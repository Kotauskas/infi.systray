Overview
========
This module implements a Windows system tray icon with a right-click context menu. It was originally developed by Infinidat, but I have decided to fork it and document it better and edit the internals to be compatible with Python 3.

Installation
------------
The original infi.systray module by Infinidat is available at PyPI, but this isn't. Clone it or download through ZIP then copy the systray folder into `<Python 3 install directory>\Lib\site-packages`. Not very difficult, yes?

Usage
-----
This section was moved to the Wiki.

Credit
------
This repo is forked from Infinidat's infi.systray repo. README there states:
>This module is adapted from an implementation by Simon Brunning, which in turn was adapted from Mark Hammond's
>win32gui_taskbar.py and win32gui_menu.py demos from PyWin32.
